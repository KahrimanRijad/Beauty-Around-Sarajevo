              Every mountain will teach us something, it teaches us about change and being prepared to change, teaches us patience, persistence and gratitude, teaches us to enjoy the small luxuries in life, teaches us to be positive and that we will meet the most amazing people who we will call friends due to the bond and similar goals.
              Mountain climbing, also known as mountaineering or alpinism, is an activity for people who like to climb mountains up to its summit. This activity requires perseverance, high technical skills and fitness level, thus mountain climbers often are physically and mentally prepared, adventurous, have high level of confidence and are able to survive and adapt in harsh conditions. 
              Mountain climbing is not a solo activity where you can complete it alone. It requires a group of people with each member both supporting and supported by the group’s achievement at every stage. Most importantly, only experience trekkers can take part in this activity. Having pre-climbing experience, the ability to understand the glacier and forecast weather, being competent in both rock and ice climbing techniques, having common sense and good judgmental skill to not only stay safe but alive, and being familiar with the use of equipment to ensure that one is able to use it in ease, is fundamental in mountaineering.
              In addition, a backpack consisting of sufficient equipments such as an ice axe, boots with crampons, rope, ice screws, mountaineering food, gloves, gaiters and sunglasses may weigh up to 30kg. Not forgetting, mountain climbers do carry bottles or packs of water to ensure that they stay hydrated at all times.
              In order for mountain climbers to succeed and acquire a sense of achievement, they risk their life and limb to thin air, frostbite, bone-chilling cold, hypothermia, avalanche and high wind to reach their target. Furthermore, accidents may happen unexpectedly and this may cause complications. Many mountain climbers actually experience frequent altitude sickness as the altitudes varies when they ascend or descend to and fro the summit of a mountain. Significantly, to decrease from getting into potential dangers, mountain climbers are extremely cautious of boulders or rocks from falling onto them, falling into crevasses and slipping on ice slopes. 
              In this page we will go through the most basic equipment needed for hiking, the rules we must follow and the way to get to the mountains around Sarajevo (Trebevic, Visocica, Bjelasnica) and the largest mountain in Bosnia and Herzegovina and it is Maglić.

                <h1>Trebević</h1>
                <p class="textarea">
                  An easy walk to the top of Trebević as an excellent escape from the city smog.
    
    After the Pine Hotel, take the asphalt road and then turn left through the forest for a more pleasant walk. You can also continue on the right on asphalt / macadam. Follow the markings through the forest, the asphalt / macadam path that cars can pass through will be cut three times and the ruined home of Dobra voda will be reached. Here you can continue straight on (in the direction of the macadam / asphalt path) by serpentines to the top of Trebevica (approx. 1.5 hours), and you can turn towards Dobri vode, pass them and go uphill towards pl. home of Jure Franko. This route goes that way. Continue straight along the well-trodden path and reach the part where the macadam intersects the path, continue only straight and reach the crossroads along the beaten wet path. On the left is a shortcut to pl. home, on the right is the road to Austro-Hungarian artillery positions. I recommend going straight (for a nice view) and only then turn left and climb a little to the home that is uphill to the right.
    The road to the top over the ridge is from pl. at home, follow the path of off-road vehicles (impossible to reach by ordinary car) to the home to the markings on a tree that shows the road to the right to the top over the ridge, follow the paved path and markings and in about 40 minutes you are at the top.
    The return way can be the same way as this route, or it can be extended for five minutes from the top, then turn left onto the path that leads to the top via a serpentine and you will reach Dobri Vode. Lots of options for making fine tours.

                Mountain Visočica surround Rakitnica, Neretva and Ljuta, as well as the mountains of Bjelašnica, Treskavica, Prenj and Crvj. The easiest approach to this mountain is asphalt through Sarajevo through Babino, where the Ski Center of Bjelasnica to the village of the showroom in which the mountain lodge "Vrela" was built.
    From the mountaineering home to cross the asphalt road and the first meadows with a slight rise, fitting right on a macadam road that accompanies the path from the show from Sarajevo for a greater distance and greater altitude. After a completely 2 km, this macadam road fits into a narrow asphalt, which continues in a larger up on the left, a few hundred meters to the first houses. Here, turn left on the dirt road following mountaineering marks. The further trail becomes all narrower and soon from the meadow is entering the Hardwood Forest, where after one part with a large rise reaches the fountain with drinking water. There is also the boundary of forest vegetation. The trail is located below in the right end of the natural amphitheater. When you go to the top of Vito on that track after 200 meters, you have a stone market for the path to the house called "Zoran Šimić" which is made as a shelter from the storm.

              <h1>Bjelašnica</h1>
              <p class="textarea">
                Bjelasnica or as the locals say the Olympic mountain with the highest point called the observatory is 2067 meters above sea level. It is not difficult to climb Bjelašnica by car or bus, .but it should never be underestimated as young mountaineers back in 1962. Observatory (2067 MASL) is the highest summit on Mt Bjelašnica. There are several ways to reach it, but this time we chose the route Babin do - Štini do - observatory. You can reach Babin do by car from Sarajevo, via the road to Bjelasnica, and once you arrive you can park your car there.
                After two kilometers of gentle upward slope you reach Štini do. This is where the "House of Salvation" is located, a dilapidated shelter above which the ascent begins. After you turn right from the shelter you will notice three transformer stations leading to the top, which can serve as a visual clue. The trail itself is very strenuous and rather steep; the ascent is constant, and the higher up you climb the stronger the wind, usually. The transformer stations can serve as wind shelters for short breaks.
                
                The observatory is just a few hundred meters away from the third transformer station, the last in the row. Here the wind can make it difficult to move, so you should be extremely careful. In the observatory building there is a room where you can rest and get some refreshments. It is clean and warm, and the employee on call usually offers the fallenwalkers some tea or coffee.
                
                You can return via the same route, or via the ski track, the out-of-use downhill track to do Babin do via Kolijevka, an unused ski resort.In 1962, one of the greatest mountaineering tragedies in the former Yugoslavia took place. A group of eleven people, members of the sports section "Our Wings" from Zemun and the mountaineering association "Željezničar" from Sarajevo set out for Bjelašnica on November 29, 1962 "
                
                The oldest member was 31 years old, and the others were between 15 and 19 years old.
                
                Seven mountaineers, five from Zemun and two from Sarajevo were killed.
                Eleven young men, members of the Cinema Club, set out for Bjelašnica on December 2, 1962, to record the area of ​​the mountain with a camera for the documentary "White Death". The lives of seven of them were interrupted by white death.
                
                The organization was bad, the people of Zemun were poorly trained and shod, some were even in moccasins, and the leader of the action was unauthoritative.
                They ignored the janitor's pleas "not to go to the top because bad weather is brewing - which led to death in a snowstorm speed of 160 km / h. This is proof that the mountain should not be underestimated.

              <h1>Maglić</h1>
              <p class="textarea">
                Maglić is the highest mountain in Bosnia and Herzegovina, 2637 meters above sea level. It was named after the famous fog that is formed so quickly and which is there for an average of 300 days a year. It is located on the border of Bosnia and Herzegovina with Montenegro. This mountain overlooks a heart-shaped lake called "Trnovačko Lake".
                This ascent takes place - direction Poštar, from Lokva Dernečište (1,642 m above sea level) to the top - category (difficult trail) around 3 h.
                Activity plan:
                - From the direction of Sarajevo, drive along the road M18 Sarajevo - Brod na Drini 75 km (Foča) further - M20 towards Tjentište, 27 km - at the old gas station that is not working - turn left towards Dragoš Sedlo (signpost). Drive on the macadam road 18 km to the crossroads - left towards Dernečište, 1.58 km.
                - Gathering and departure is at Tjentište, (turning at the old gas station) no later than 07:00 h. Departure from Dernečište to the top at 08:00,
